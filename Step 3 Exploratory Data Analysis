# In this section we are working with a cleeaned dataset from the previous module, and we will perform 
# some exploratory data analysis. Finding the distribution of data, presence of outliers, and determine 
# the correlation between differnt columns in the dataset. 
#
# Import pandas and load the dataset
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m2_survey_data.csv")

# Plot the distribution curve for the column 'ConvertedComp'
df.ConvertedComp.plot(kind='kde')

# Plot the histogram for the column 'ConvertedComp'
df.ConvertedComp.plot(kind='hist')

# What is the median of the column 'ConvertedComp'
df.ConvertedComp.median()

# How many responders identified themselves only as a "Man"
menOnly = df.query('Gender=="Man"')
menOnly.Gender.value_counts()

# Find out the median 'ConvertedComp' of responders that identified themselves only as a "Woman"
SubDf = df.query('Gender=="Woman"')
SubDf.ConvertedComp.median()

# Give the five number summary for the colun 'Age'
df.Age.describe()

# Plot a histogram of the column 'Age'
df.Age.plot(kind='hist')

# Next we will focus on finding the outliers 
#Import numpy
import numpy as np
# Find out if outliers exist in the column 'ConvertedComp' using a box plot
df.ConvertedComp.plot(kind='box')

# Find out the Inter Quartile Range for the column 'ConvertedComp'
Q1 = df.ConvertedComp.quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df.ConvertedComp.quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3-Q1
print("Inner Quartile Range:",IQR)

# Find out the upper and lower bounds
LB = Q1-1.5*IQR
UB = Q3+1.5*IQR
print("LowerBound:",LB,"UpperBound:",UB)

# Identify how many outliers are in the 'ConvertedComp' column
sum(df.ConvertedComp>=UB)

# Create a new dataframe by removing the outliers from the 'ConvertedComp' column


# Next we'll focus on finding correlation
# Find the correlation between 'Age' and all other numerical columns
df.corr()['Age']

# Now we have a better understanding of our variables and their relationships as well as the distribution of our data
