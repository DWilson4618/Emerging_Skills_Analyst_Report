# Emerging_Skills_Analyst_Report

## This project is apart of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone
### This repository is to serve as a structure from raw data to a simple analysis report complete with an interactive dashboard.
### Each section will follow the steps taken and is meant to serve as a guide through the project
### This Repository is to act as a hub for the code used, provided in a clean format for easy duplication, deeper analysis, future projects, or just a simple review.
## For each section of this Repository, the files that were used were provided by coursera and IBM in the beginning of each section. You can either use the same files or use the files you will create in each section.
