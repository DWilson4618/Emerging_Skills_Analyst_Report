# This section will focus on Wrangling the data set that we have previously collected and stored
#
# Import the pandas module and load the dataset into a dataframe
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m1_survey_data.csv")

# How many duplicate values are in the dataset, remove them, then check that the dups are gone.
df.duplicated().value_counts()
df = df.drop_duplicates()
df.duplicated().value_counts()

# Find the missing values
df.isnull().sum()

# How many missing values are in the column 'WorkLoc'
df['WorkLoc'].isnull().sum()

# Now we will work of filling those missing values with the mode value of the column and verify
df['WorkLoc'].value_counts()
df['WorkLoc'] = df['WorkLoc'].fillna("Office")
df['WorkLoc'].isnull().sum()

# Next we focus on normalizing the dataset, we have two columns in the dataset that talk about compensation
# One is 'CompFreq' (How often the dev is paid) and the other is 'CompTotal' ( How much they get paid)
# We will focus on normalizing by creating a column called 'NormalizedAnnualCompensaton' for easier analysis
#
# First list out the various categories in the column 'CompFreq'
df['CompFreq'].value_counts()

# Create the new column and update its value based on the Freq the dev gets paid then check the results
def fillComp(freq,total):
    if freq == 'Yearly':
        return total
    elif freq == 'Monthly':
        return total * 12
    elif freq == "Weekly":
        return total * 52

df['NormalizedAnnualCompensation'] = df.apply(lambda row : fillComp(row['CompFreq'],row['CompTotal']), axis = 1)
df[['NormalizedAnnualCompensation','CompFreq','CompTotal']]

# Now we have a dataset that we can draw real connections from
